# C-book-excercises

This is basically me going through and taking notes on "The C Programming Language 2nd Edition" by Kernighan and Ritchie
A pdf of the book is included in this repo, along with my solutions to the excersises in each chapter (with proper comments...)

Note if you would like to contribute, the general format is as such: 
    1.) make a seperate directory/folder for each chapter, and within it, have 2 seperate folders:
        1.1) for the C code itself
        2.2) for Excecutables which run the C code
    2.) try following similar naming convention such as "Chapter'N'Excercise where n is chapter number
    3.) do not change anything in the cbook folder, it is just a copy of the book
